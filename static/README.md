# Purpose of this directory

For the proof-of-concept api implementation, data from the Image Matching Algorithm will be stored in this directory. This will be eventually be replaced by an actual datastore. At that time, this directory will likely be removed.

## TSV files

Data from the Image Matching Algorithm will be stored as one or more .tsv files, with one row per suggestion. These files may be refreshed at any time. If files are replaced while the service is running, the service may need to be restarted to recognize the new .tsv files.

### JSON files

The application may (or may not) convert some or all of the .tsv files into .json files for its use. No guarantees are made about the presence or absence of any such .json files. If any exist, they should not be removed while the application is running. Any necessary .json files that are removed while the service is stopped will by regenerated by the service as needed once it is running again.
